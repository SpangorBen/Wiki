Wiki Content Management System

Wiki is a collaborative platform designed to offer an efficient content management system along with a user-friendly front office, providing an exceptional user experience.
Project Overview

The primary objective of Wiki is to create an environment where administrators can easily manage categories, tags, and wikis, while authors have the flexibility to create, modify, and delete their own content. The front office focuses on a user-friendly interface with features like simplified registration, an efficient search bar, and dynamic displays of the latest wikis and categories for seamless navigation.
